[12:51:14 AM] Kepa Auwae: Check screply.df and sharp.df - also
currently blogic.df is set up to run one of the blurbs I did as
examples over and over. Do that and put gnomey or mason or santa in a
group.
[12:51:28 AM] Kepa Auwae: It works, but I have no idea how it works
really.
[12:51:34 AM] Kepa Auwae: Which isn't a great sign.

[12:52:07 AM] Kepa Auwae: Like with useful-info in sharp-df, lines 6
and 8 and 10 ... I really don't know for sure how the logic works here.

[12:52:33 AM] Kepa Auwae: Same with screply.df line 66

[12:53:24 AM] Kepa Auwae: With sharp.df lines 8 and 10, I'm not sure
why sc-reply is returning 1.

[12:54:21 AM] Kepa Auwae: With sc-check in screply.df, not sure why
sc-pick returns 0 if something picked successfully. Or what it returns
if unsuccessful really.

[12:54:34 AM] Kepa Auwae: But when trying to logic it out, I failed to
have anything work right.

(*
	The goal here was to avoid my original plan where I had a big word
	called sc-verify, that checked if the 2nd character's specialtype
	was a valid one, and then had an almost identical word of logic
	checks that determined what the character said. So I tried to have
	just one word, sc-pick, that would serve as both.
