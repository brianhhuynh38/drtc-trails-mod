	: CAVEMAN-oneline2 "We didn't have zombos where I'm from. What did you do to get them?" ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline3 "MAYBE I was sleeping in that ice on purpose! Maybe I like ice." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline4 "These zombos are slow, but so is ice and that can sneak up." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline5 "I need a bigger weapon." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline6 "Are talking dinosaurs still around?" ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline7 "I speak your language cause I've done time travel once, ice sleep twice." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline8 "I'm used to this future travel. It happens a lot to me." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline9 "I'm sure there's a time portal around, somewhere in Canada." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline10 "Maybe I shouldn't go back to past. I'll just fall asleep in ice again." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline11 "For monsters, zombies are real slow. I'm going to get lazy fighting them." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline12 "Dinosaurs were all coated in feathers. They looked ridiculous." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline13 "At least I didn't travel to the far far future this time." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline14 "I wonder how many others get frozen in ice. I do, all the time." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline15 "Running is better than being eaten. Not as good as smashing." ;
	: CAVEMAN-oneline16 "I can't get used to your 'guns' fad. Give me a tree trunk, any day." ;
